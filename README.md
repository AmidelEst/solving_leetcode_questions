# 🧠 LeetCode Python Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my **LeetCode Python Solutions** repository! This is my personal journey through various LeetCode challenges, where I solve problems and enhance my Python programming skills one question at a time.

## 📚 About the Project

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems solved using Python. Each problem is solved in a separate file, following the format:

```
{LeetCode Question Number} - {LeetCode Question Name}.py
```

### Example:
```
1 - Two Sum.py
2 - Add Two Numbers.py
```

By structuring it this way, you can easily find the solution to any problem based on its number and title. Each solution is optimized and includes comments to explain the thought process behind it.

## 💡 Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is a great platform for:
- Practicing algorithmic and problem-solving skills
- Preparing for coding interviews
- Enhancing Python knowledge
- Building up a portfolio of solved problems!

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python 🐍
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, and LeetCode
